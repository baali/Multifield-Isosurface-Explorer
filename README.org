* Overview
  Identification of important isovalues of scalar fields is a well studied 
  problem. In this application we have used a relation-aware approach to 
  explore scalar multifield data. In the context of multi-field data,
  we calculate a variation density function, whose profile is a good 
  indicator of interesting isovalues of individual scalar fields. 
  The application, includes a graph viewer to plot the variation density 
  function against isovalues and an Isosurface viewer to interact 
  with Isosurfaces. The implementation is based on ideas described in 
  the [[http://vgl.serc.iisc.ernet.in/pub/paper.php?pid=013][paper]] by Suthambhara N. and Vijay Natrajan published in 
  IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics 2011. [fn:1]

* Installation
  Download Kappa-app from github
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/baali/Kappa-app.git
  $ cd Kappa-app
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  #+END_SRC

  + Dependencies
    - OpenCL drivers.
    - VTK 5.9+ build with 
      #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      cmake -DVTK_USE_QT=ON -DVTK_USE_GUISUPPORT=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON 
      #+END_SRC

* Usage
  + To start application navigate to build folder and either double click
    the MIE file or type the following in the terminal
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ ./MIE
    #+END_SRC

    #+ATTR_LaTeX: width=10cm

  + The application handles Unstructured data grids with multiple scalar fields. 
  + The isosurface shown in the right pane corresponds to the scalar field 
    selected from the first drop down list. 

    #+ATTR_LaTeX: width=10cm
    [[./images/load_file.png]]
  + Select two scalar fields from the drop down menu, that you want to 
    compare and calculate the variation density function. 

  + Two charts are displayed after calculations are over. One is of Variation 
    Density profile and the other is the isosurface statistics.

    #+LaTeX: \newpage
  + To select isovalues, you can either click on points displayed in the 
    chart, use the slider, or the text box. Local mamima, minima and points
    with high slope in the chart may correspond to interesting isovalues.

* Breakdown
  + GUI 
    - GUI4.ui is the UI design of application.
    - GUI4.h and GUI4.cxx are files where all the signals and slots are 
      defined. 
  + OpenCL 
    - pointData.cl is the kernel file.
    - Points.Cxx takes care of creating buffers, passing the data to GPU
      and invoking kernel.
    - cll.cpp and cll.h are files which take care of Hardware detection, 
      kernel compilation and all.

* Issues/TODOs
  + Not able to highlight the selected point on the chart.
  + Still there are cases when I am getting NaN during calculations, locate 
    and handle them.

  + Suthambhara, it was his code base and research work which is behind this 
    application.
  + [[https://github.com/ccluri][Chaitanya]] and Dilip for all the help in getting GUI setup and other 
    tweeks working.
  + [[https://github.com/punchagan][punchagan]]
  + Code base for GUI are taken from VTK Example kits for Qt.
  + OpenCL tutorials and source code from [[http://enja.org/][enja]]. Base of all openCL code for this
    application was taken from his [[https://github.com/enjalot/adventures_in_opencl/][github]] repository.
