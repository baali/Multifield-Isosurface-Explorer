Kappa GUI Application Readme

* Overview
  Its an application to calculate variation density function that profiles 
  the relationship between multiple scalar fields over isosurfaces of a 
  given scalar field. This profile serves as a valuable tool for 
  multi-field data exploration because it provides the user with cues to 
  identify interesting isovalues of scalar fields. It is based on paper
  about [[http://vgl.serc.iisc.ernet.in/pub/paper.php?pid=013][Relation-aware isosurface extraction in multi-field data]].

* Installation
  Download Kappa-app from github
  + $ git clone https://github.com/baali/Kappa-app.git
  + $ cd Kappa-app
  + $ mkdir build
  + $ cd build
  + $ cmake ..
  + $ make

  + Dependencies
    - OpenCL drivers.
    - VTK 5.9+ build with 
      cmake -DVTK_USE_QT=ON -DVTK_USE_GUISUPPORT=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON 

* Usage
  + To start application navigate to build folder and either double clik
    qtevents file or in terminal type
    $ ./qtevents
  + This application works for Unstructured data grid with multiple 
    scalar fields.
  + Select two scalar fields from drop down menu, among which you want to 
    calculate variation density function. 
  + The isosurface shown in the separate window if for scalar field in first 
    drop down list. 
  + There will be two charts displayed after calculations are over, one is 
    of Variation Density function and other one is for isosurface Statistics.
  + To change isovalues, you can either click on points displayed in the 
    Chart, use slider or the text box.
    
* Breakdown
  + GUI 
    - GUI4.ui is the UI design of application.
    - GUI4.h and GUI4.cxx are files where all the signals and slots are 
      defined. 
  + OpenCL 
    - pointData.cl is the kernel file.
    - Points.Cxx takes care of creating buffers, passing the data to GPU
      and invoking kernel.
    - cll.cpp and cll.h are files which take care of Hardware detection, 
      kernel compilation and all.

* Issues/TODOs
  + Not able to highlight the selected point on the chart.
  + Still there are cases when I am getting NaN during calculations, locate 
    and handle them.

    application was taken from his [[https://github.com/enjalot/adventures_in_opencl/][github]] repository.
